# Arduino Button + LED Project

My first Arduino (Elegoo Uno) project for building CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) foundations relevant to satellite systems.

## ⚡ Project Overview
This project turns an LED on and off using a push-button connected to the Elegoo Uno R3 (Arduino-compatible). It demonstrates basic embedded system control logic — a core principle behind CPS and space systems.

## 🛰 Relevance to Satellites & CPS
- Button = Simulates a command signal (e.g., ground station instruction)
- LED = Simulates a physical action/output (e.g., deploy antenna, activate system)
- Demonstrates fundamental command → action logic used in satellite operations

## 🛠 Components
- Elegoo Uno R3 (Arduino-compatible)
- Breadboard
- Push-button
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires

## 📝 How It Works
When the button is pressed, the LED turns on. Releasing the button turns the LED off.
